***Readme***
------------

Thank you for playing.  This is a free (as in libre...and beer) implementation 
of Magic: The Gathering.  This readme will cover a few things you can do to 
configure the game or troubleshoot problems if you ever need to.  We feel that 
the workings of the game are fairly explicit, but if at any time you have 
questions please send an e-mail to: 

magic@sourceforge.com


===Howto===
-----------

*How do I begin playing the game?

If you are on Windows there will be a shortcut under the Start menu.  If you 
are on Linux or another OS, there will be a magic.desktop file under the 
installation directory, or your package manager may have handled it for you.


*How do I create my own decks?

Easy.  All you need to do is go to your deck directory (you would have set that 
up during installation or you can view it in the magic.conf file under the 
installation directory) and create a deck list there.  A deck list basically 
looks like the following template:

19      Swamp   		sinkhole/Swamp.jpg
1       Lake of the Dead        sinkhole/Lake of the Dead.jpg
2       Barren Moor     	sinkhole/Barren Moor.jpg
3       Phyrexian Rager 	sinkhole/Phyrexian Rager.jpg
...

or, more generically, each line is basically 3 tab delimited fields:

amount of this card	card name	path/to/image

Use the sample deck for reference if you need further assistance.  The image 
path is relative to the base directory, which is where the deck list is.  It's 
good advice to follow the convention of placing your images in a sub-folder of 
the base directory, with some name relating to the deck.  This way it's easy to 
share.

When you're finished, save your decklist as *.lst.

It's recommended to get your images from the official database, located at:

http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?


*How do I share my deck with others?

The preferred method is zip files.  Please navigate to your deck directory 
(you would have set that up during installation or you can view it in the 
magic.conf file under the installation directory) and zip up the decklist, plus 
the folder containing the images (and the images).  Upload or e-mail this zip 
file anywhere and others can download it and begin playing with it right away!


*I've downloaded someone else's deck.  How do I use it?

If you've viewed it to ensure correct formatting (deck list and a sub-folder 
of images), just unzip it to the base deck directory (you would have set that 
up during installation or you can view it in the magic.conf file under the 
installation directory).  If it's following an obscure convention then just 
modify it to your needs.


===Configuring===
-----------------

*I've decided to change the base directory for my decks.  How do I do this?

Under the installation directory, just open magic.conf and find the line 
labeled:

DECK_BASE="/path/to/your/directory"

and just modify that to point to your new directory.  You may want to make sure 
that directory exists first, and also move all of your decks there.


===Troubleshooting===
---------------------

*The game won't start.  What do I do?

Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed by visiting: 

http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

If you still have issues, feel free to contact the developers.


*One of my decks uses a lot of tokens and the game crashes after a lot have 
been entered.  How do I fix this?

Under the installation directory, just open magic.conf and find the line
labeled:

MEM="128"

and just increase that number as needed.  We highly recomend staying under 
1024.  In fact, we encourage that you contact us if you have issues with 512.  


===Common _issues_===
---------------------

Why did you use Java?!  It's blah blah blah blah...

No, it's not.  Whoever told you that was either lying or trolling.


I would like feature XYZ added.

Great.  E-mail the dev team and we will get back to you with a response.  If we 
disagree, feel free to add the feature yourself.  The source code is provided, 
after all.


I would like to contribute.

We consider users to be contributers, especially if you offer feedback, which 
we're sure you do...right?  ;-)  If you mean in a development roll, then 
fantastic.  How?
